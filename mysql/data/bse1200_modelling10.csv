Their manufacturing facilities are located in Balrampur, Babhnan, Tulsipur, Akbarpur, Gularia, Maizapur, Mankapur, Rauzagaon, Haidergarh and Kumbhi. It has an installed crushing capacity of ~80,000 TCD per day. Its 5 distillery units operate at a capacity of 1050 KLPD. Its 10 co-gen power units generate power output of ~176 MW.
